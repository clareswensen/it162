<p>THANK YOU ALL for supporting us!!!<br>
My big dreams for this little pub are actually coming true! I have loved being able to meet so many wonderful people from the community and hear about your lives and experience the joy of hosting your reunions and birthday parties. Itâ€™s all more than I could have hoped for. Although we are far from perfect, and strive to become better with each passing day, the warm embrace of this beautiful neighborhood makes all the hardships well worth it! It may have been my own vision, but it is DEFINITELY all of you that brought it to life. That being said, without my right hand WOmen, the vision could not have left the page. My kick ass, hard working, beautiful, determined, unparalleled team of bad ass broads, have been the FACE, the BACKBONE, the GUTS and the beating HEART of this operation! As we continue to grow, I sincerely hope you will continue to join us in this journey.
I'm just a girl, who loves food and drink, and after 15 years of bartending, bought a bar. I didn't know what would happen, or even if I could do it by myself. But here we are and I'm proud to say, WE ARE DOING IT!! Lake City, you have taken us in and we hold your patronage as a badge of honor. I truly can't thank you all enough. Please continue to <b>Eat, Drink, and be Lively</b> with us!!!! With all my love, CHEERS!!!</p>
